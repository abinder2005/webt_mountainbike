            <p id="catchfrase">The best riders around the world don´t only earn lots of money and take cool looking videos,
                        they also develope our sport further and further. When back in 1990 it seemed crazy to do jumps, or to ride down roots and stones on a bicycle, 
                        proriders nowadays do double backflips over canyons. Down there some of the most important and succesful riders are listed.

            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>   
            <p>The austrian supertalent Fabio Wibmer is even for non-mountainbikers a term. Having the most succesful bicycle videos on Youtube with some over 100 million views it´s not surprising that he´s one of the 
                biggest german speaking youtubers. He is also one of the most paid mountainbikers with being youtuber, being sponsored by Red Bull and Specialized, and having an own clothing brand "Sick Series. Fabio 
                rides bikes since he was a little child. Back then he only owned a trial bike wich is still his main bike. Later he got his first downhill bike and started racing as a side activity to the trial but because he is so good on any bike he soon became one of the best in the world on both bikes."  </p>
