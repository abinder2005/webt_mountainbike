    <p>One of the most popular events is the Red Bull Rampage. This crazy show is yearly held in Utah Usa and was first
        carried out in 2001 and was won by Wade Simmons.</p>

        over a canyon or jumping off a 20 meter cliff are normal things to see there.</p>
    <p>The riders are flewn up the rampage mountain by a helicopter and the judges who sit down in the valley give them
        points for tricks, speed and style.</p>
