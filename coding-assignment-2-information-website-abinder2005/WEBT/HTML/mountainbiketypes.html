        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            As some people might not know there is more than just 1 mountainbike type. There are lots of different bikes for different purposes of usage. 
            <br>
            You can distinguish if you wheter like to climb mountains, like to ride down the mountains or like to jump. 
            <br>
            On this website you will get to know about the differences between mountainbikes.

        <h2>Cross Country</h2>
        <div class="crossCountryImage">
            <img src="../pictures/crossCountry.jpg" alt="cross country" width="500">
        </div>
            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>
                The Cross Country or XC bike's main category is climbing mountains. It's made for going up big mountains but not really to ride them down 
                <br>
                after you climbed a mountain. Mostly XC-bikers ride down on the street.
            </p>
            <h3>Suspension</h3>
            <p>
                Most of the XC-bikes are hardtails. That means that they only have a fork in the front. Then there are fullys as well. Fullsuspension
                <br>
                bikes (fullys) do have additional to the fork in the front a rear shok. XC-bikes have approximately 80mm - 120mm of travel. Suspension
                <br>
                is necessary to absorb strong impacts.
            </p>
            <h3>Racing</h3> 
            <p>
                There is a own world cup all about XC-racing. It's called UCI XCO World Cup. The athletes try to get as light weight as possible. 
                <br>
                XC-bikes weigh about 8kg - 12kg.

        <h2>All Mountain and Trail bikes</h2>
        <div class="allMountainImage">
            <img src="../pictures/allMountain.jpg" alt="all mountain" width="500">
        </div>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>
            The all mountain or trailbike is the most common bike. It can be used for simple tours in flat land or for big tours in alpine terrain.
            <br>
            It's good for climbing mountains but you will also have a relatively smooth downhill ride.
        </p>
        <h3>Suspension</h3>
        <p>
            The usual trailbike is fullsuspensioned with a travel from 120mm - 160mm.
        </p>
        <h3>E-Bikes</h3>
        <p>
            Since 2015 many manufacturers produce trailbikes with an electric motor. The motor helps you on big tours and supports you until you
            <br>
            reach a velocity of 25km/h. The negative aspect of E-Bikes is the highly increased weight. Normal trailbikes weigh 11kg - 15kg,
            <br>
            whereas E-Trailbikes weigh about 20kg - 25kg.

        <h2>Enduro and Super Enduro</h2>

        </div>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>
            The endurobike's geometry is designed to ride the bike downhill but also to go up with it. Endurobikes are seen in bikeparks and 
            <br>
            mainly in their main discipline. Riding in alpine terrain on high mountains. 
        </p>
        <h3>Suspension</h3>
        <p>
            Enduro bikes have a travel from 150mm - 180mm and are fullsuspensioned. This huge amount of travel allows a comfortable ride down 
            <br>
            the mountain. Super enduros or freeride bikes have even more travel and their geometry is more based on riding down a mountain.
        </p>
        <h3>Racing</h3>
        <p>
            There is a championship called EWS (Enduro World Series) where the best endurobikers race against each other. This couple of very
            <br>
            hard races take place in Italy, Austria, Canada, Switzerland and many more countries.

        <h2>Downhill</h2>
        <div class="downhillImage">
            <img src="../pictures/downhill.jpg" alt="downhill" width="500">
        </div>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>
            Downhill bikes are designed for the most extreme and roughest terrain. Their geometry is only deigned for descending from 
            <br>
            a mountain and not to climb it. You can't climb any mountain with a downhill bike. That's primarly because of their high gear
            <br>
            which they need for pedaling at high speed.
        </p>
        <h3>Suspension</h3>
        <p>
            Downhill bikes are the bikes with the highest amount of travel on their suspensions. The travel is about 180mm - 215mm and 
            <br>
            that gives the bike a relatively stable and comfortable descent even on the rockiest and most root blocked tracks.
        </p>
        <h3>Racing</h3>
        <p>
            The best and most skilled riders ride in the UCI Downhill Worldcup which takes place all around the world. This year's hosters
            <br>
            were Portugal and Slovenia.

        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>
            Dirtjump or Slopestyle bikes are bikes for huge jumps. This jumps are primarly built out of earth and boost their riders about
            <br>
            10m - 15m through the air. BMX (Bike Motocross) bikes are ridden in skateparks or indoor skatehalls. BMX bikes are like dirtjump
            <br>
            bikes very light and BMX bikes mostly have no brakes.
        </p>
        <h3>Suspension</h3>
        <p>
            Dirtjump bikes have a fork with a travel around 120mm. Sometimes they also have a shock in the rear. BMX bikes don't have a 
            <br>
            suspension at all.
        </p>
        <h3>Competitions</h3>
        <p>
            The most important competitions for professional dirtjump riders are Crankworx and Audi Nines. Crankworx takes place in Austria, 
            <br>
            New Zealand, Canada, and many other countries. It's not only a dirtjump event but it also features a downhill race. Audi Nines
